# Optimal Packing App ðŸ“¦

The Optimal Packing App is a powerful tool designed to solve complex packing problems. Whether you're dealing with 2D or 3D spaces, designed algorithms ensure efficient packing solutions.

## Features

### 2D Packing Solutions:
- **GA + BLF**: Utilizes Genetic Algorithm combined with Bottom-Left Fill.
- **GA (using Evotorch) + BLF**: Uses GA from Evotorch library and combines it with Bottom-Left Fill.
- **Pointer Network + MAXRECT**: Uses a Pointer Network approach combined with the MAXRECT algorithm.

### 3D Packing Solutions:
- **GA + DBLF**: Implements Genetic Algorithm combined with Deepest Bottom-Left Fill.
- **GA (using Evotorch) + DBLF**: Uses GA from Evotorch library and combines it with Deepest Bottom-Left Fill.
- **Pointer Network + DBLF**: Uses a Pointer Network approach combined with the Deepest Bottom-Left Fill algorithm.

Additionally, a mobile app was developed for this project that uses AR to enhance 3D problem visualization:
